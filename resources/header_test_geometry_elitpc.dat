#### Angles of U/V/W unit vectors wrt X-axis [deg]
#
ANGLES: 0.0 -120.0 -60.0
#
#### Length of pad's edges [mm]
#
DIAMOND SIZE: 1.0
#
#### Offset in [mm] of the reference point wrt X-Y plane origin
#
REFERENCE POINT: 0 0
#
#### Electron drift velocity [cm/us]
#
DRIFT VELOCITY: 1.0
#
#### Electronics sampling rate [MHz] (eg. (512 cells)/(25 MHz)/(1cm/us) = 20.48 cm window can be recorded, length of drift cage is 20 cm)
#
SAMPLING RATE: 25.0
#
#### Electronics beam "t0" trigger delay [us]   (eg. (512 cells/2)/(25 MHz) = 10.24 us delay is needed for the beam entering in the middle of the drift cage at t=0)
#
TRIGGER DELAY: 10.24
#
#### Acceptance of drift cage along Z-axis (cathode has the highest Z, beam axis has Z=0 by definition)
#
DRIFT CAGE ACCEPTANCE: -98.0 98.0
